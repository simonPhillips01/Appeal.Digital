Technical test

I completed this test in intervals of 30 mins so I could spend some time thinking about what needed to be completed next and how best to do so. The box shadow needs some alterations so it looks as the design does. I also need to play with the images so they don't look stretched. The padding on the review column needs to be changed to be an exact match to the design.
